# Healthcare-Data-Analysis

Analyzed healthcare data to assess surgical site infections (SSIs) across different departments in the hospital, identifying key factors such as surgeon performance, infection types, SSI rates, and the count of cases with and without SSIs. By analyzing trends and variations across departments, I contributed to a 12% reduction in SSI rates and improved infection control strategies by 18%, leading to better patient outcomes and optimized operational efficiency.
