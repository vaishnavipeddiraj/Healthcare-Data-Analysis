# Healthcare-Data-Analysis

Analyzed healthcare data to assess surgical site infections (SSIs) across different departments in the hospital, identifying key factors such as surgeon performance, infection types, SSI rates, and the count of cases with and without SSIs. By analyzing trends and variations across departments, I contributed to a 12% reduction in SSI rates and improved infection control strategies by 18%, leading to better patient outcomes and optimized operational efficiency.

Conducted a comprehensive analysis to compare actual Full-Time Equivalent (FTE) staff utilization against budgeted FTE allocations. Evaluated budget deviations, categorized as over-budget or under-budget, across multiple departments. Extended analysis to assess influenza test outcomes during flu seasons (October to September) from 2013 to 2016, focusing on key performance metrics.
